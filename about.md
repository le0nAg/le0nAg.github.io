## whoami

An eternal student with a great passion for computer science, which I nurture with every resource at my disposal—from academic studies to work and free time.  

<!-- In addition to algorithms, technologies, and development design strategies, I have a particular focus on the world of cybersecurity, which I constantly deepen through CTF challenges. -->

## Why this blog?

For the past few years, I’ve been exploring the worlds of cybersecurity and hacking - a vast universe full of curious stories, vulnerabilities, exploitation and mitigation techniques.
It’s a wonderland where software complexity, mathematical beauty, societal dynamics, wired things, and human intelligence all collide and interact in a chaotic dance.
After gaining some experience, I decided to carve out a space where I could write about what I’ve learned and challenge myself through a kind of “structured random learning”, in other words: doing [Feynman technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching#Plastic_platypus_learning).
Even if most of the articles (most probably) will be security related I don’t exclude articles on other of my passions/interests like logic, Balkans, analog photography.

# What comes next?

(Un)fortunately, this is a very busy period of my life and —since  
*“Time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so.”*  
~ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy  
— the amount of time I can dedicate to writing articles and documenting projects is approximately 0…

BUT, if you're curious and would like to explore on your own, here is the list of articles and projects already scheduled and planned for public release between January and February:
