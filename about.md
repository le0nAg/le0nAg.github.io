## whoami

An eternal student with a great passion for computer science, which I nurture with every resource at my disposal—from academic studies to work and free time.  

In addition to algorithms, technologies, and development design strategies, I have a particular focus on the world of cybersecurity, which I constantly deepen through CTF challenges.

## why this blog

For the past few years, I’ve been exploring the worlds of cybersecurity and hacking - a vast universe full of curious stories, vulnerabilities, exploitation and mitigation techniques.
It’s a wonderland where software complexity, mathematical beauty, societal dynamics, wired things, and human intelligence all collide and interact.
After gaining some experience, I decided to carve out a space where I could write about what I’ve learned and challenge myself through a kind of “structured random learning”, in other words: doing Feynman technique.
Even if most of the articles (most probably) will be security related I don’t exclude articles on other of my passions/interests like logic, Balkans, analog photography.
