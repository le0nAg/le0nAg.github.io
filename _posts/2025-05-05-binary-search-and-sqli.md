<!-- # The importance of writing your own exploit: binary search and SQLi -->

## Introduction

Like many I started my journey in web application hacking through CTFs (and I seriously raccomend them, it’s a valuable and funny way to learn!) but after googling some details of some CTFs that I was unable to solve, as happens when you don’t know something, I happened to read some write-ups of the solution.
In most of the cases you will find a brief explanation of the vulnerability and a very vertical one of the exploitation process used to get the flag.
Also in most of the cases you are going to use some tools that to almost of the work to you, presenting to you the solution like a magician takes a rabbit from his hat.
The combination of all of this things make sure that you hardly understand fully and deeply the vulnerability that you exploited.
Does this matters? It depends, let’s go!

When and why is it important to understand deeply vulnerabilities?
In most of the cases, if you are performing a penetration testing for an average company, that needs average tradeoff security it’s highly unlike that you will go deep in the process of exploring the vulnerabilities since the attack surface is very vast and it your objective is not that of discovering all the 0-days of the system but
