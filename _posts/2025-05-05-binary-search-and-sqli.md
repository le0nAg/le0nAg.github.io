# The importance of writing your own exploit: binary search and SQLi

## Introduction

Like many I started my journey in web application hacking through CTFs (and I seriously raccomend them, it’s a valuable and funny way to learn!) but after googling some details of some CTFs that I was unable to solve, as happens when you don’t know something, I happened to read some write-ups of the solution.
In most of the cases you will find a brief explanation of the vulnerability and a very specif one of the exploitation process used to get the flag.
Also in most of the cases in those writeups you are going to use some pre-build tools that do almost all of the work for you, giving you the flag or a prebuild exploit.
Using them is like watching a magician taking a rabbit from his hat, but I think that the really cool part of hacking is the curiosity, is the willing of understanding the magic behind that trick.
With this article, and generally with this blog, I want to try to go deeper in the white rabbit hole.
Today we are going to see two important concepts of computer science and cybersecurity: time complexity and SQL injections.

## What is time complexity?

## What is a SQLi? Types and detection

## Blind SQLi: two approaches burpsuite vs scripting

## Bonus tip: parallel code runs faster
